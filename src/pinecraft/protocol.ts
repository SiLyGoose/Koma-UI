/*
 * What this page and the Koma bot say to each other over Pinecraft's WebSocket. A copy of the bot's
 * src/web/pinecraft-protocol.ts (in the Koma repo): change both together.
 *
 * The bot holds the world. The page is sent the blocks around the miner, one string per row and a
 * letter per block:
 *   .  open (the starting room, or dug)
 *   d s b   dirt, stone, bedrock
 *   c i o x e r   coal, iron, gold, diamond, emerald, ruby
 *   ?  not seen yet
 * A block is only sent once the miner can see it (next to open ground they can walk to).
 *
 *   page -> bot   hello    first message: the token from the link
 *                 mine     starts breaking the block that way (no answer)
 *                 map      asks for the map of everything uncovered
 *                 move     one step; `seq` counts up from 1 with every move. Into a block, it finishes
 *                          breaking it: the bot holds the move until the block's break time has
 *                          passed since its `mine` (or since now, without one)
 *   bot -> page   state    the world around the miner, after the page's move `seq` (0: not after one)
 *                 map      the map asked for
 *                 error    and the bot closes the connection
 *
 * Watching: a watch-only page says `watch` with the token from its watch link instead of `hello`,
 * and is then sent everything the player's page is sent about the game (not their errors), starting
 * with `watching` (whose game it is) and the world as it is. `away` says the player's page went away
 * (it may come back); `breaking` says they started on a block. A watcher can ask for the player's
 * `map` too. The player is sent `watchers` whenever how many are watching changes.
